# Pygame Platformer Project

This folder contains exercises and files created while learning Pygame, specifically by following a tutorial series by **DaFluffyPotato** on YouTube. Pygame is a popular Python library for creating games, providing tools for handling graphics, sounds, and input, which makes it ideal for building 2D games and experimenting with game development.

## Learning Goals

Through this tutorial, I am learning:
- The fundamentals of game development using Pygame
- Key concepts like tile maps, physics, and collision detection
- Advanced features such as particles, animation, camera control, and AI
- How to organize a game project and make an executable version

## Project Overview

The tutorial guides you through building a platformer game that includes:
- Tile-based levels with scrolling and parallax backgrounds
- Basic player mechanics like jumping, dashing, and attacking
- Enemies with basic AI, along with level transitions and a simple level editor
- Advanced features like screen shake, particles, and animations to enhance gameplay
- Audio integration for sound effects and music
- Optimization for performance, particularly in tile rendering
- A camera system for smoother gameplay and better visual effects
- A level editor to create custom game levels

## Features Implemented

1. **Game Finalization**: Polished the core mechanics and features to complete the game loop.
2. **Audio**: Integrated background music and sound effects for various game events.
3. **Outlines & Transitions**: Added visual outlines for certain game objects and smooth transitions between levels or states.
4. **Screen Shake**: Implemented screen shake effect for impactful gameplay events (e.g., collisions, explosions).
5. **Enemies**: Created enemy characters with AI behavior, including movement and interaction with the player.
6. **Dash**: Introduced a dash mechanic, allowing players to quickly move in any direction.
7. **Jump Slide**: Added a jump-slide mechanic for smoother player movement.
8. **Particles**: Integrated particle effects, including visual flair for actions like explosions or jumps.
9. **Level Editor**: Built a basic level editor to create and customize game levels.
10. **Animation**: Worked on player and enemy animations to make movement more fluid and realistic.
11. **Tile Optimization**: Optimized tile rendering and management for better performance.
12. **Camera & Sky**: Enhanced the camera system and sky rendering for a more immersive experience.
13. **Player, Tiles, & Physics**: Focused on player mechanics, tile maps, and physics such as gravity and collision detection.
14. **Images, Input, & Collisions**: Implemented input handling, sprite images, and collision detection for interactive gameplay.
15. **Initialization**: Set up the initial game environment, including the window and data management from the tutorial.
