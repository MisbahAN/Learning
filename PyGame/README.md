# Pygame Platformer Project

This folder contains exercises and files created while learning Pygame, specifically by following a tutorial series by **DaFluffyPotato** on YouTube. Pygame is a popular Python library for creating games, providing tools for handling graphics, sounds, and input, which makes it ideal for building 2D games and experimenting with game development.

## Learning Goals

Through this tutorial, I am learning:
- The fundamentals of game development using Pygame
- Key concepts like tile maps, physics, and collision detection
- Advanced features such as particles, animation, camera control, and AI
- How to organize a game project and make an executable version

## Project Overview

The tutorial guides you through building a platformer game that includes:
- Tile-based levels with scrolling and parallax backgrounds
- Basic player mechanics like jumping, dashing, and attacking
- Enemies with basic AI, along with level transitions and a simple level editor
