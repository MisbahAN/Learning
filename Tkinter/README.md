# Learning Tkinter

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created while learning Tkinter through CodeWithHarry's YouTube tutorial series. It includes small projects, examples, and experiments that cover key features of Tkinter such as:

- Creating and managing windows
- Using widgets like buttons, labels, and entry fields
- Event handling and command binding
- Layout management with grid, pack, and place
- Creating menus and status bars
- Working with images and custom fonts
- Handling user input and file operations

### Projects:
1. **Notepad** - A simple text editor with features like opening, saving, and text formatting.
2. **Calculator** - A basic calculator with a GUI that performs arithmetic operations.
3. **Edmonton Travel System** - A form to collect user details and save them for a mock travel booking system.
4. **Window Resizer** - A dynamic window resizer that changes background color based on window dimensions.

**Goal by the end of the course**: To gain a solid understanding of Tkinter's core functionality and apply this knowledge in building functional applications.

**Acknowledgments**: Special thanks to CodeWithHarry for providing free and comprehensive Tkinter tutorials on YouTube; his efforts are truly appreciated.
